# Files
* AbilityClass - Explains what goes in an ability class. This class will contain what the move actually does; as well as config variables, permissions, load messages, names, descriptions, and more!
* AbilityListener - This will contain the event that triggers the AbilityClass. For instance, the trigger of this ability is a click. So when a player clicks, the AbilityClass will be triggered!
